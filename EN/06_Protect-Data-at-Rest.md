# Protection of Data-at-Rest

([Back](../README.md))

## Objective

Protect data at rest by default (e.g. storage) for cloud-based workloads.

## Key Considerations

- [ ] Implement an encryption mechanism to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data when data are at rest in your solution's storage.
- [ ] Use CSE-approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols, in accordance with [ITSP.40.111](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cryptographic-algorithms-unclassified-protected-and-protected-b-information-itsp40111) and [ITSP.40.062](https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/system/files/pdf_documents/itsp.40.062-eng.pdf).

## Validation

- [ ] Confirm that storage service encryption is enabled for data at rest (if required based on the security risk assessment)
- [ ] Cryptographic algorithms and protocols configurable by the consumer are leveraged in accordance with ITSP 40.111 and 40.062.
- [ ] Confirm that privacy is included as part of the Departmental SDLC process.
- [ ] Confirm that a key management strategy has been adopted for the cloud tenant.

## Additional Considerations

- [ ] Seek guidance from privacy and access to information officials within institutions before storing personal information in cloud-based environments.
- [ ] Leverage an appropriate key management system for the cryptographic protection used in cloud-based services, in accordance with GC [Considerations for the Use of Cryptography in Commercial Cloud Services and CCCS guidance on key management](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-cloud-service-cryptography-itsp50106).
